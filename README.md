# Weekly Chore Tracker

A single-page application built for tracking personal chores (or other to-do items) on a weekly basis. View chores by day, add new tasks to the calendar, edit or delete existing ones, and mark chores as completed. All information is stored in a db.json file and persists across page loads.
